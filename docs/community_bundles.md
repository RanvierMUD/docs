Bundles are what make Ranvier work and are made to be shared. This is a list of bundles written by the community for
you to drop into your game. To get a bundle you've published added to this list send a pull request to the
[docs](https://github.com/RanvierMUD/docs) repo. For installation see the [Bundle Guide](bundles.md) as well as any
specific instructions each bundle may provide
